## Results-Driven Experience Showcase

My work centers on delivering measurable improvements in system performance, deployment efficiency, and application intelligence.

### Software Developer Co-op | Opreto (Jan. 2025 - Apr. 2025)

- **Cloud Architecture Automation:** Automated complex AWS infrastructure (Cognito, ECS, S3, CloudFront, Route53) using Pulumi, reducing infrastructure setup time from days to less than 1 hour via one-click deployments.
- **AI Performance Optimization:** Delivered an AI meeting assistant (TypeScript, React, NestJS) that improved transcription accuracy by 30% by integrating and optimizing Deepgram and OpenAI APIs.
- **Quality & Deployment:** Engineered CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and achieved 90%+ test coverage across backend and frontend services using Jest and Playwright E2E testing.
- Packaged and shipped a secure, cross-platform Electron desktop application with code signing and auto-updates, streamlining secure multi-platform releases for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Software Developer | Adaptable Services (Dec. 2022 - Dec. 2023)

- **API Performance Engineering:** Optimized the Node.js/Express backend using GraphQL, achieving a 30% reduction in API response times for faster data delivery.
- **Architectural Refinement:** Implemented Context API across 15+ components, eliminating prop-drilling and reducing code complexity by 35% for improved maintainability.
- **Front-End Quality:** Converted detailed Figma designs into pixel-perfect React.js components, reducing cross-device UI bugs by 40%.

## Featured Systems & Architecture Deep Dive

**Project: Cartly: MultiModal Shopping Assistant**

A multimodal AI assistant demonstrating mastery in vector database optimization and complex API integration.

- RAG Performance Tuning: Developed a RAG-based assistant using LangChain and Pinecone. Optimized similarity thresholds through experimentation, resulting in a 60% reduction in irrelevant results while sustaining 85% precision across 800 products.
- Low-Latency Multimodality: Integrated BAML intent classification with the Gemini Vision API to enable image-to-query translation. Achieved sub-second response times by implementing multi-view vector indexing and statistical filtering.
- Stack: React, TypeScript, Python, Flask, LangChain, Pinecone, BAML, HuggingFace, Gemini Vision API.

**Project: OnBoard AI: Autonomous Multi-Agent Onboarding System**

A multi-agent AI system built with CrewAI that automates personalized, compliant employee onboarding by intelligently searching company policy documents.

- Efficiency Metric: Reduced the time to create a complete onboarding package from a manual 2+ hours to a fully automated 5 minutes (95% efficiency gain).
- Multi-Agent Architecture: Utilizes two specialized agents, a Policy Researcher Agent (semantic search on PDFs) and an Onboarding Writer Agent (generating personalized, actionable content).
- Stack: CrewAI, FastAPI, React/TypeScript, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers, Python.

**Project: DevHub: Real-Time Social Platform**

- Engineered real-time social features, including notifications and analytics, using Socket.IO.
- Secured user onboarding using JWT and Google One Tap via OAuth 2.0, streamlining user access and improving retention.
